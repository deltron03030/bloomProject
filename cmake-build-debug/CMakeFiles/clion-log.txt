CMake Warning (dev) at /usr/local/lib/cmake/assimp-5.0/assimpTargets.cmake:54 (if):
  if given arguments:

    "ON"

  An argument named "ON" appears in a conditional statement.  Policy CMP0012
  is not set: if() recognizes numbers and boolean constants.  Run "cmake
  --help-policy CMP0012" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy command to
  set the policy and suppress this warning.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /usr/local/lib/cmake/assimp-5.0/assimp-config.cmake:1 (include)
  CMakeLists.txt:18 (FIND_PACKAGE)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Deprecation Warning at dependencies/GLFW/CMakeLists.txt:10 (cmake_policy):
  The OLD behavior for policy CMP0042 will be removed from a future version
  of CMake.

  The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
  policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
  specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
  behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.
